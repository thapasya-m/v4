- Engineered a bash (SLURM) script that seamlessly integrated over 3 university and lab servers, reducing processing time by over 10 hours while building a seismic data pipeline and preparing source-to-target mapping.
- Leveraged AWS Lambda, S3, and RDS in an ETL pipeline, hosted on a Linux cluster within a university server environment.
- Orchestrated the creation of an ETL pipeline on a university server, significantly decreasing processing time by more than 10 hours using parallelized job execution in bash/shell scripts.
- Reconfigured the Wasserstein GAN with Markov Chain Monte Carlo model in MATLAB to generate synthetic 2D oceanic data from a dataset spanning over 500 Pacific stations over the last 20 years.
- Trained a lung ultrasound centric convolutional network for video classification in lung ultrasound, achieving an impressive 85% training accuracy using TensorFlow & Jupyter notebook.
- Innovated the convolution network architecture by incorporating class-activated map (CAM) weights from a prior VGG-16 variant model, resulting in a remarkable increase in precision up to 83%.
