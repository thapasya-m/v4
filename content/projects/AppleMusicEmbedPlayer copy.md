Using the portable and more accessible option of lung ultrasound (LUS) volume sweep imaging for initial tests and prognosis is a potential solution. In the paper we go over the application of Deep learning, specifically VGG based model, in combination with the rule-based classifier for Lung ultrasound images. The method performs with 85% accuracy and 83% precision as a result.
